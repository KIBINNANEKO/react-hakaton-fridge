Disclaimer:
The hackathon took place on February 1, 2023. In this hackathon, I was a frontend developer in a team consisting of two .NET backend developers and a designer. Only my code is presented here, which may not be very polished due to the limited time for completing the task.

"From a Hungry Edge...
Sometimes we all crave something delicious, but our fridge is empty. To avoid such situations, it's worth buying the necessary ingredients for our favorite dishes in advance. However, it's not always easy to keep all the recipes in mind, and keeping them in a book seems a bit old-fashioned. Your task is to develop an application that helps users calculate the amount of ingredients they need to buy for a specific dish."

Functional requirements for the application:

- Ability to view the set and quantity of ingredients needed to cook the selected dish.
- Ability to view the recipe for the selected dish.
- Ability to view all the ingredients available to the user.
- Ability to view a categorized list of available products (dairy products, vegetables, fruits, etc.).
- Ability to view dishes that can be prepared with the available ingredients.
